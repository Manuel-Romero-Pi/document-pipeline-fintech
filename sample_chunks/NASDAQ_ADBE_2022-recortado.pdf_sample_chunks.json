We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a\nportion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized\nforeign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and\ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\n\nOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n<table><tr><th>(in millions)</th><th>2022</th><th>2021</th><th>2020</th></tr><tr><td>Euro</td><td>€ 2,487</td><td>€ 2,209</td><td>€ 1,887</td></tr><tr><td>Japanese Yen</td><td>¥ 118,456</td><td>¥ 104,829</td><td>¥ 88,640</td></tr><tr><td>British Pounds</td><td>£ 737</td><td>£ 669</td><td>£ 562</td></tr><tr><td>Australian Dollars</td><td>$ 876</td><td>$ 768</td><td>$ 645</td></tr></table>\n\nAs of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and\nforwards, were $3.25 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in Indian Rupees,\n$480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other\nforeign currencies. As of December 2, 2022, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through November 2023. The bank\ncounterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting\narrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security\nagreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2022. This sensitivity\nanalysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S.\nDollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar\nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our\nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the\nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\n\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in\ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the\nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization\nand retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and\nDecember 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749\nmillion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency\nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging\nprogram and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.",
